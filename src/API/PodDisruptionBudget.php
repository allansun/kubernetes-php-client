     * @param string $namespace object name and auth scope, such as for teams and
     * projects
     * @param array $queries options:
     * 'allowWatchBookmarks'	boolean
     * allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do
     * not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the
     * server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any
     * specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event
     * during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature
     * gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
     * 'continue'	string
     * The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server.
     * Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from
     * a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of
     * continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If
     * the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration
     * (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the
     * server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue
     * token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without
     * the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the
     * token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting
     * from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the
     * previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the
     * first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
     * after the "next key".
     *
     * This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from
     * the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any
     * modifications.
     * 'fieldSelector'	string
     * A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to
     * everything.
     * 'labelSelector'	string
     * A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to
     * everything.
     * 'limit'	integer
     * limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items
     * exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value
     * that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of
     * results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up
     * to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
     * should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more
     * results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and
     * will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue
     * field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This
     * field is not supported if watch is true.
     *
     * The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be
     * identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects
     * created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included
     * in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a
     * consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive
     * smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.
     * If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was
     * present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * 'resourceVersion'	string
     * resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be
     * served from. See
     * https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
     * for details.
     *
     * Defaults to unset
     * 'resourceVersionMatch'	string
     * resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It
     * is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
     * resourceVersion is set See
     * https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
     * for details.
     *
     * Defaults to unset
     * 'timeoutSeconds'	integer
     * Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call,
     * regardless of any activity or inactivity.
     * 'watch'	boolean
     * Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add,
     * update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
     * 'pretty'	string
     * If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
