 *  1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the
 * "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName).
 *  2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to
 * securely (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName).
 *
 * This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to
 * kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or
 * to obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.
